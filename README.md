## Description
This is a an app that will be used to help with memory recall in Alzheimer's patients.  The app will use a set of algorithms to determine the best time to show the picture using emotion ratings, tags and color data.

###Current Abilities
The app is able to add photos to an album after logging in through Google.

###Future Goals
Ideally, with each upload, you will be able to enter if the photo contains close relatives, friends, acquaintances, strangers, favorite objects, etc.  You will also be able to answer if you love the photo, like the photo, don't care about the photo, etc... so that hormones that are released while looking at the pattern of photos are able to be hypothesized based on your self-reported feelings about the photo.  Then, ideally, after looking at so many photos, the results are connected to a backend computing platform that will determine the pattern of images that are likely to produce the most cognitive success in patients.  This will be deteremind by having a series of 1-question quizes after so many images.

## Tools
This app uses React for the frontend, Express for the backend, and MongoDb and Cloudinary for the database structures.
